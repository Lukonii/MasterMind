# MasterMind
I made console game - Masters of Mind game using only C language. Before you start follow all instructions from Readme

You want to try game. Just start MasterMind.exe
But if you want to edit code and modify game by your own, than follow some steps.

1. Install compiler.</br>
    -download compiler from my google drive link https://drive.google.com/file/d/16PgoOr4eKKM5yI9_vmnvN5IjtdEHfq6V/view?usp=sharing</br>
    -start installation</br>
    -go to C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin and in that folder copy bcc32.cfg and ilink32.cfg from .rar document you downloaded from my drive.</br>
2. Copy files.</br>
    -in C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin copy MasterMind.cpp</br>
    -in C:\Borland\BCC55\Include copy defkey.h</br>
    -in C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin create empty Mind.txt file</br>
3. Compile files.</br>
    -your projcet should be located in C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin folder and also compiled there</br>
    -start cmd and navigate to C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin to compile code in cmd enter bcc32 [name of your project].cpp (in this case MasterMind.cpp)</br>
4. Start program.</br>
    -in cmd type [name of your project].exe
